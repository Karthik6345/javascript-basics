What is Redux thunk?
1) A thunk creator, which is an action creator that returns a thunk (a.k.a. asynchronous action creators)
2) The thunk itself, which is the function that is returned from the thunk creator and accepts dispatch and setState as arguments

Why Redux thunk?
The reason that we need to use a middleware such as Redux-Thunk is because the Redux store only supports synchronous data flow. 
Thus, middleware to the rescue! Middleware allows for asynchronous data flow, 
interprets anything that you dispatch and finally returns a plain object allowing the synchronous Redux data flow to resume. 
Redux middleware can thus solve for many critical asynchronous needs (e.g., axios requests).
