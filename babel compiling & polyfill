Babel is a transpiler which converts advanced Ecmascript features into browser compatible code.This compilation does not add any 
property to the code.
eg: arrow functions into plain function

Polyfill converts the code with browser compatible method.
eg: includes will be replaced by indexOf
    Promise call would be replaced by browser compatible method.
